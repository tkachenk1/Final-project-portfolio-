        <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>My name is Victoria Tkachenko and I am an undergraduate student at <a class="intext-link" href="https://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a> majoring in a field of Interactive Arts and Technology.  I consider myself an aspiring digital designer, specializing in 3-D modeling of objects and their environemnts. I find my work to follow the principle of beginning a project by working with a traditional pencil to explore, generate, and visually communicate new ideas, and then transform the planned out design into a digital software). My favorite program that I  use for 3-D modeling is the application called Autodesk Maya, where I usually build the texture and create the lighting for my model. Additionally, I use the program Rhinoceros 3D to create mathematically precise models of my projects like<a class="intext-link" href="projects.html"> “This Chair is Not a Chair”</a>.</p>
          <p>I would love to work for a company that is a pioneer in providing the most modern graphical design, and one that would challenge my creativity and imagination. My interest with graphical designing lies with 3-D modelling and animation. However due to my interest with novelty I would also be interested in exploring new type of methods of creation in the field of graphic designing . The positions that I would be interested in would be graphical designer and digital designer.</p>
