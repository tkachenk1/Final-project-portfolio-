     <h2>This Chair is Not a Chair</h2>

<p><b>Overview</b><br>
  The aim of this group project is to plan a parametric sitting surface applying rapid sketching for a quick prototyping of ideas, further developed by CAD tools supporting surface and solid modeling.</p>



<p><b>Limitations</b><br>
  One of the requirements for this project is to consider human dimension so the chair can suit one individual.  Our  group had to be focused on the proportions of the final model where we were not allowed to exceed the limits of  a 24"x24" bounding box. Moreover, the final model of the chair should provide an aesthetically satisfying form such that it can be utilized as an art object.</p>


<p><b>Solutions</b><br>
  There are three main steps used to create the solution to this problem: sketching, digital modeling and physical modeling.</p>

  <p><b>Individual work</b><br>
This project was done in a group of two. My partner, Fatima Imran was working on the first part of the sketching creating initial ideas of the chair. Also she used Grasshopper to make the connection between the model made in Rhino and Grasshopper diagram to waffle the final design. In my turn I sketched different variations of the same model and modified it by transforming the shape of the chair. I also worked on the digital modeling part which was done in a Rhino.


  <p><b>Results:</b><br>
The overall design of the chair was graded as a good model. However, the only problem that our group did not consider is a small sitting surface. In order to fix that we could extrude the top line part of the sitting surface using transformation tool in Rhino.</p>

   <h2>Candelabra Modeling</h2>
    <p><b>Overview:</b><br>
     The goal of this project is to create two photo-realistic renders of the same 3D virtual environment and one main object occupying the scene. To accomplish this task I had to
     combine techniques of modeling, texturing, and lighting in a software called Maya.
    <p><b>The description of the achieved environment:</b><br>
TProject “Photo-realism”  features a candelabra standing in the middle of a dinner table in a summer house, during the late afternoon. The scene setting is occuring in an indoor environment and features a vibrant natural white light in conjunction with a faint indoor light. </p>
